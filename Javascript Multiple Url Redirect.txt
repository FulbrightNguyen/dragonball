Where to Place Javascript Multiple Url Redirect
You modify the list of urls to as few as two to as many urls as you wish. Make sure each url is on a separate line with a comma after each url except 
the last one in the list.

After changing the urls in the list to your needs, copy and paste all of the code from the textbox above and place it anywhere in the web page between 
the <head> and </head> of the web page. If you use Wordpress you will want to install a plug in that allows you to insert javascript in individual posts.
